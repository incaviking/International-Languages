            <h3>Court interpreting during a pandemic</h3>
            <h3 class="article-text1"><img src="./assets/icons/user-icon.svg" class="glyphish-icon"> Remedios Sullivan -
                December
                14, 2019</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 health crisis around the world has had a definite impact on the court interpreting
                profession. In Wisconsin, same as everywhere in the USA, the impact on interpreters have been many.
                Although some courts are very slowly going back to in person hearings, the pandemic brought certain
                challenges interpreters must continue to deal with.</p><br><br>
            <p>On site interpreters in the courthouse must battle specific problems. The acoustics of most courtrooms
                are not always the best, but interpreters adapt and may use court resources. For example, during onsite
                simultaneous hearings we can move closer to the person speaking or the speaker system. Some courthouses
                have headsets for hard-of-hearing individuals and interpreters can access them for their interpreting
                since the sound is much more amplified, and the sound is much clearer.</p><br><br>
            <p>Face masks and glass shields further silences the speaker and increases interpreter requests for
                repetition, asking everyone in the courtroom to speak closer to the microphone. Some colleagues have
                mentioned that face masks difficult their comfortable breathing and create a feeling of claustrophobia,
                adding an extra layer of stress to their work.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>Most interpreters I know can make sense of a long day interpreting by sharing a cup of coffee or
                discussing about a specific case in the cafeteria or going to lunch together. This camaraderie is
                especially useful in the profession, creating an atmosphere of mutual respect, receiving valuable input
                about our interpreting work. Working from home isolates us in the profession and although we can always
                reach out to colleagues by phone or app, it is not the same.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Some interpreters are using headset equipment when interpreting in person for defendants but that
                requires constant disinfecting. Things get a bit more complicated when it is a long hearing requiring
                two interpreters who now must share the same transmitter.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hybrid on-site and VRI appointments can be confusing. An interpreter during COVID times must keep their
                laptops and headphones in tow when doing on site appointments because some courthouses may have some
                hearings in person and others via Zoom. An assigned interpreter would have to switch back and forth
                between hearings.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Video remote interpreting was introduced rapidly, without much training and out of necessity to carry on
                with court proceedings. It has proven to be a difficult tool for everyone to master and interpreters are
                not the exception. Not everyone is tech savvy (defendants do not know how to connect) and everyone must
                deal with background noises such as kids crying, a dog barking, defendants walking, jostling with their
                phones or even being in a moving vehicle while their hearing is being held.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Although there are a number of VRI platforms, courthouses mostly use Zoom to conduct virtual hearings and
                broadcasting them live on YouTube. The industry has been adapting quickly and proactively introducing
                safety mechanisms to secure the sessions from hackers and disrupters such as Zoom bombers. However, on
                the simultaneous interpreting side, things do not look 100% robust yet.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Court interpreters primarily use the simultaneous mode when working but the pandemic has thrown a monkey
                wrench in all this. Most courtrooms have a challenging time understanding the
                platformâ€™s simultaneous settings that many long hearings (sentencings for example) require. Because of
                this, many courtrooms choose to conduct their hearings using the consecutive mode, generating
                frustration for court officials, interpreters and attorneys who are not accustomed to this slower pace.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Having a dependable computer with a wired internet connection is optimal to avoid video lapses during a
                VRI appointment but it is not always feasible. Sometimes one must rely on a strong unfluctuating
                wireless connection using a laptop or tablet to take care of business. These wireless devices carry
                their own problems depending on things such as the latest application, computer age, and whether if it
                is a Mac or Window. While some interpreters use simple earbuds to connect, it is optimal to buy quality
                microphone and headphone units with noise cancellation features to maximize interpreter efficiency in a
                comfortable environment.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>For sure the world has recently experienced changes that will mark the interpreter profession for a long
                time to come but everyone knows that even after the COVID-19 crisis relents, some of the changes will be
                part of the new normal. Court interpreters are resilient and are quickly adapting to this new normal by
                assimilating new technology, teaching others on correct tech usage, improving the flow of hybrid
                appointments, following proper safety protocols and working hand in hand with court officials.
